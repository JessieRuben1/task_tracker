# Task Tracker CLI

`task_cli.py` is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help you track and manage your tasks effectively. It allows you to:
- Add, update, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as in progress or done.
- List tasks based on their status.

This project uses a JSON file for persistent storage, ensuring your tasks are saved and retrievable even after the program ends.
